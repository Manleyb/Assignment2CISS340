# You will need two queries for this one. It can be done in one but it will require too much copying.
# Using the previous query, create a view (this will help you from copy pasting it) and display the ratio of women to men for each department. Display department and ratio rounded in 2 decimals points.
# For the view use: CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW
# Otherwise scripts will fail if a view exists
